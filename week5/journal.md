# Containerization of Java Project using Docker

## Project Overview

### Section 8: [Project Phase/Type]

Brief description or purpose of this phase or type of project.

#### Scenario:

for example, the legacy application is a multi-tier application stack and is running on VMs, that could be running on physical machines, and as per today's trend, agile, we need continuous deployments and deployments.

#### Problems:
High CapEx and OpEx  
Chance of Human errors in deployments  
Not compatible with microservices architecture.  
Resource wastage  
Not Portable, envs not in sync  

#### Solution:

Containerization  
Consumers low resources  
suits well for microservice design  
In containerization, deployments are done via images
Same container images across environments  
resusable and repeatable
