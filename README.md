# 90daysofdevops

This is my journal of my DevOps learning journey and projects. I will learn different things, do projects, follow bootcamps, and read books.

## Week 1 & 2:

I have followed Andrew Brown's AWS Cloud Bootcamp. Here is my working journal for the 1st and 2nd weeks ([Week 1 and Week 2](https://github.com/sumamazaeem/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023)).

## Week 3:

I started reading the book "Terraform Cookbook." You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/sumamazaeem/Terraformcookbook).

Furthermore, to enhance my learning of Terraform, I followed "The Infrastructure Developer's Guide to Terraform: AWS Edition" from Cloud Academy. It is a hands-on lab to enhance learning, and you can access it [here](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/terraform-on-aws-1-2377/).

From the above Learning Path of Terraform, I followed the 8 Labs as follows:

1. Lab: Installing Terraform on Windows and Linux
2. Lab: Deploying AWS Infrastructure with Terraform
3. Lab: Configuring Implicit Dependencies in Terraform
4. Lab: Creating Variables in Terraform Configurations
5. Lab: Using Provisioners with Terraform
6. Lab: Exploring Terraform State
7. Lab: Using Terraform Remote State
8. Lab: Creating Reusable Infrastructure with Terraform Modules

## Week 4:

In Week 4, I documented my progress in the [journal.md](week4/journal.md) file. Additionally, I incorporated the results of two tasks:

### AWS Lift and Shift Project

Detailed documentation of the Lift and Shift AWS project has been provided in the [Week 4 Project Journal](week4/journal.md). It covers the architecture, objectives, execution flow, and a comprehensive summary of the project.

### Re-Architecturing Web App on AWS Cloud

The [Week 4 Project Journal](week4/journal.md#re-architecturing-web-app-on-aws-cloud-cloud-native) contains a thorough overview of the Re-Architecturing Web App project on AWS Cloud. The summary includes the reasoning, scenario, solution, AWS services used, objectives, architectural details, execution flow, and the successful deployment summary with an accessible URL.
