# Continous Integration using Jenkins, Nexus, Sonarqube and Slack

## Project Overview


### Section 8: [Project Phase/Type]


#### Scenario:

The project is in development and agile SDLC is used, dev makes regular code changes, and commits need to be built and tested continuously. Usually, the build and release team will do the job or developers' responsibility to merge and integrate code.

#### Problem:
Frequent code changes, depended on Q/A team. errors keep accumulating.
dev team needs to rework and fix the bugs and error. not fast possible as the test is done manually and inter-team dependencies

#### Solution:

Regular automated build and test for every commit and notify on every step, fix if any problem happens. The process is called Continuous Integration.

#### Benefits:

- Shorter MTTR
- Works well with AGILE
- NO Human intervention
- Fault Isolation

#### Tools:
- Jenkins
- Git
- Maven
- Checkstyle
- Slack
- Email notification integration
- Sonatype Nexus (Artifact/software repo)
- Sonarqube (Code Analysis server)
- AWS Ec2

#### Objective:
- Fault Isolation
- Short MTTR
- Fast Turn around on feature changes
- Less disruptive
